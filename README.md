## Hyfer

This is a small setup for the project. `react-router-dom` is added and configured so please take a look in `app.js` to how it all work.

Also [css modules](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules) is enabled, it's an easier way of styling without caring about if class names collide. Please take a look at css modules.

The structure is made so that it's not so hard to integrate you already built parts of the project.

Run 'yarn' to install needed dependencies then you can run `yarn start` to start the app.
